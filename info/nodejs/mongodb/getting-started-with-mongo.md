  <p>What is MongoDB</p>
</header>
<p>MongoDB is a NoSQL (pronounced No Sequel) database system
designed to make querying data pretty easy.</p>
<p>A NoSQL database essentially holds searchable JSON
documents.</p>
<p>It is best used when data is related but
is semi-structured or even completely unstructured; that is to say
there are no natural keys.</p>
